# Tools Reference

This section provides reference for the main tools in the R-Type projet:

### CMake
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) : CMake is an open-source cross-platform build system that is widely used in the software development community. It is designed to automate the build process of software projects, making it easier to compile, test, and package applications across different platforms and build environments.

### Conan
[Conan](https://docs.conan.io/2/integrations/cmake.html) : Conan CMake integration combines the functionality of both Conan and CMake to simplify the management of dependencies in C/C++ projects. It allows you to write CMake code that seamlessly integrates with Conan to handle dependency resolution and retrieval during the build process. With Conan CMake, you can specify your project's dependencies using Conan, and CMake will automatically handle the necessary steps to include and link those dependencies in your project's build.

### ENet
[ENet](http://enet.bespin.org/) : ENet is an open-source lightweight networking library designed for game development and other real-time communication applications. It stands for "Efficient Network Library" and provides a reliable and high-performance network communication protocol for sending and receiving packets of data over the network.

### SFML
[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) : SFML, which stands for Simple and Fast Multimedia Library, is an open-source multimedia library for C++ programming. It provides a simple interface and a set of modules for handling various multimedia tasks such as graphics rendering, window management, audio playback, and input handling. SFML is designed to be easy to use, cross-platform, and efficient.
