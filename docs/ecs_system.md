# SystemBehavior

***Description***

The `SystemBehavior` class is a component that represents a behavior system in a game or simulation. It inherits from the `IComponent` interface. It provides functionality for managing and executing behaviors associated with entities.

***Public Members***

- `SystemBehavior(EntityManager *entity)`: Constructor that initializes the behavior system with a pointer to the `EntityManager`.
- `~SystemBehavior()`: Destructor.
- `void loop()`: Performs the behavior system's main loop, where behaviors are executed.

***Private Members***

- `EntityManager *_entityManager`: A pointer to the `EntityManager` that manages the entities associated with the behavior system.

# SystemDraw

***Description***

The `SystemDraw` class is responsible for drawing entities in a game or simulation. It provides functionality for rendering entities with visual components.

***Public Members***

- `SystemDraw(EntityManager *entity)`: Constructor that initializes the drawing system with a pointer to the `EntityManager`.
- `~SystemDraw()`: Destructor.
- `void loop()`: Performs the drawing system's main loop, where entities are rendered.
- `void setWindow(Window* window) noexcept`: Sets the window in which the entities will be drawn.

***Private Members***

- `Window *_window`: A pointer to the window where entities will be drawn.
- `EntityManager *_entity`: A pointer to the `EntityManager` that manages the entities associated with the drawing system.

# SystemMouvement

***Description***

The `SystemMouvement` class is responsible for handling movement-related logic in a game or simulation. It provides functionality for updating the positions of entities with movement components.

***Public Members***

- `SystemMouvement(EntityManager *entity)`: Constructor that initializes the movement system with a pointer to the `EntityManager`.
- `~SystemMouvement()`: Destructor.
- `void loop()`: Performs the movement system's main loop, where entity positions are updated.

***Private Members***

- `EntityManager *_entity`: A pointer to the `EntityManager` that manages the entities associated with the movement system.

# SystemSound

***Description***

The `SystemSound` class is responsible for handling sound-related logic in a game or simulation. It provides functionality for playing sounds associated with entities.

***Public Members***

- `SystemSound(EntityManager *entitymanager)`: Constructor that initializes the sound system with a pointer to the `EntityManager`.
- `~SystemSound()`: Destructor.
- `void loop()`: Performs the sound system's main loop, where sounds are played.
- `void setSoundManager(SoundManager* soundManager) noexcept`: Sets the sound manager responsible for playing the sounds.

***Private Members***

- `EntityManager *_entitymanager`: A pointer to the `EntityManager` that manages the entities associated with the sound system.
- `SoundManager  *soundManager_`: A pointer to the sound manager responsible for playing the sounds.
